As a mentor, I would handle student concerns with professionalism. In this case, I'd provide personalized feedback to a student's code review. If the student responds negatively, I would address it privately, understanding their feelings. I would also offer specific examples of personalized feedback and explain your review approach. Along with the above responses I also think it is important to apologize if necessary, and suggest further discussion to resolve the issue. If there's a social media complaint, I would request private resolution. If necessary after taking all the above mentioned responses, I would seek help if needed to ensure a positive learning environment and a strong mentor-student relationship.

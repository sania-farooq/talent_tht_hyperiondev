As a mentor responsible for a 6-month bootcamp with 20 part-time students, I've identified three student groups: 5 who are falling behind, 10 at risk of falling behind, and 5 ahead of expected progress. Here's the proposed action plan:

Lagging Students (5):
Conduct individual mentor sessions to understand their challenges.
Provide personalized support, extra mentoring, and reviewing, and some extra resources.
Organize study groups with advanced students to help them catch up.

At-Risk Students (10):
Assign mentors and reviewers for regular support.
Allow for these students to be allowed one extra mentor session per week.
Encourage time management and planning with workshops.

Students Ahead (5):
Include them in study groups to reinforce their understanding.
Ensure their progress remains unaffected.

Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:
Offer feedback and track progress for all students.
Celebrate achievements to maintain a positive learning environment.
Make schedule adjustments in mentoring sessions if needed to accommodate lagging students.
Following this plan will help us get the lagging students back on track, support at-risk students, and maintain progress for those ahead. The ultimate goal is to ensure high task completion and graduation rates for the bootcamp.

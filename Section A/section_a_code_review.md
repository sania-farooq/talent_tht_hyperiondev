Option2: Java Task

Correctness:
The string reversal function works correctly using recursion.
The Fibonacci generation function produces the first maxNumber Fibonacci numbers as expected.

Efficiency:
The string reversal function is reasonably efficient with linear time complexity.
The current implementation of the Fibonacci generation function is inefficient for larger values of maxNumber.

Style:
The code has some indentation issues and inconsistent variable naming.
Method names should follow camelCase convention.

Documentation:
The code lacks sufficient comments, making it hard to understand.

Positive Aspects:
The recursive string reversal function and Fibonacci generation using recursion are implemented correctly.

Improvements Needed:
Optimize the Fibonacci function for better efficiency.
Add more comments to explain the code logic.
Ensure consistent indentation and follow naming conventions.

Encouragement:
Good job on the recursive string reversal and Fibonacci implementation!
Focus on improving code readability with comments and proper indentation.
Keep up the good work and continue exploring more programming concepts.

Numeral to Words Converter
This is a Python script that converts a numeral (a sequence of digits without separators) into its standard way of reading in words, complete with punctuation. For example, the numeral "19093" will be converted to "Nineteen thousand and ninety-three."

Usage
Copy the numeral_to_words.py script to your project folder or incorporate the code into your existing Python project.
Import the read_number function from the numeral_to_words module.
python

from numeral_to_words import read_number
Call the read_number function, passing the numeral as a string argument, and it will return the standard way of reading the number in words, complete with punctuation.


numeral = "19093"
result = read_number(numeral)
print(result)  # Output: "Nineteen thousand and ninety-three."

Limitations
The script works well for most practical purposes, but it may become less efficient for very large numbers with hundreds of digits or more. Additionally, it assumes valid numeral input without any separators (e.g., 19,093 should be provided as "19093").
